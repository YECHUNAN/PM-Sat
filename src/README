1- Description 

PMSat is a parallel version of the SAT-solver MiniSAT. 
The parallelism and communication are achieved by using the MPI library.

3- Installation 

This program should be executed in a cluster or grid of computers with MPI (version 1.0 or higher).

Extract the contents of the tar file and use the make command to compile the source code.
You may need to change the contents of the variable INCLUDE_DIR in the Makefile to the location 
of directory '/mpich/include/' in your computer.

Then you must copy the program to every nodes of the cluster, to the same directory, if isn't 
available a shared file system. 

You may also need to disable the password request of the ssh connections to the other nodes 
of the cluster.


4- Usage and options

The boolean formulas to be solved also need to be copied to every computers 
where the program will run, if isn't available a shared file system. 

The program, pmsat, is executed by the mpirun command:

mpirun -np number-of-CPUs pmsat [options] input-file [output-file]

The parameter number-of-CPUs is used to set the number of copies of the
program to execute. p CPUs correspond to one master to manage the search
and p - 1 workers to solve the boolean formula.

The most important options of the program are -n and -m to set the number
of variables to assume and the search mode respectively.

For k variables, the search modes Sequential (s) and Random (r) make 2^k
tests while the Few first (f) and Many first (m) make only 2 × k tests.

Example: Setting the number of CPUs to 4 (3 workers and the master),
the search mode to Sequential and the number of variables to assume to 5:
mpirun -np 4 pmsat -m s -n 5 file.cnf

Example: Setting the number of CPUs to 9 (8 workers and the master),
the search mode to Many first and the number of variables to assume to 12:
mpirun -np 9 pmsat -m m -n 12 file.cnf

If you provide a name for the output file, will be created a file with the
result UNSAT or SAT and the model.

To abort the execution of the program press Ctrl-C.
